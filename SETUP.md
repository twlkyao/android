  1. Building with console:

  -  Use setup_env.sh or setup_env.bat
  -  NOTE: You must have git, ant/bin, android/tools in your enviroment path
  
  2. Building with eclipse:

  -  Run ant clean debug
  -  Open Eclipse and import *actionbarsherlock/library* project to your workspace
  -  NOTE: You must have 'tools' and 'platforms-tools' in your path in order to run setup_env.sh 

	 After those actions you should be good to go.
